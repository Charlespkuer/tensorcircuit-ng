# TENSORCIRCUIT

This project is partially inspired by [mpsim](https://github.com/grmlarose/mpsim) which builds the quantum circuit model on top of tensornetwork setups instead of directly matrix manipulations.

With TensorNetwork project announced by Google, such setup may gain benefits from swift implementation to auto differentiation abilities.

This is only an attempt project and it is at very early stage. Try it on your own risk.
