## Physics aspects

- [x] differentiable circuits with tensorflow backend in optimization setups

- [ ] svd type simulation like in arXiv:2002.07730

## Programming aspects

- [x] type hint

- [ ] make the module general enough for every tensornetwork backend and do some benchmarks

- [ ] more suitable type of visualizations

- [ ] some further considerations to compare this with tensorflow quantum/cirq
