"We introduce vmap, the advanced feature of modern machine learning "
"library, to quantum circuit simulations. By vmapping different "
"ingredients of quantum circuit simulaion, we can implement variational "
"quantum algorithms with high efficiency."

"It is worth noting that in the following use cases, vmap is supported "
"together with jit and AD which renders highly efficient differentiable "
"simulation."

"We have two different types of APIs for vmap, the first one is ``vmap`` "
"while the second one is ``vectorized_value_and_grad``, aka, ``vvag``. The"
" latter one can also return the gradient information over a batch of "
"different circuit."
