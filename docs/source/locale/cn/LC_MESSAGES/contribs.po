"Due to the compatability issue with the `JAX "
"<https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ backend on Windows, "
"we could not directly use jax backend for TensorCircuit on Windows "
"machines. Please be aware that it is possible to `install JAX on Windows "
"<https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html>`_, but it is tricky"
" and not recommended unless you have solid understanding of Windows "
"environment and C++ tools. Virtual machine is also an option for "
"development if you are familiar with it. In this tutorial we would "
"discuss the deployment of Docker for TensorCircuit since it use the most "
"convenient and workable solution for beginners."

"Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running "
"applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your "
"infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can "
"manage your infrastructure in the same way as you manage your "
"applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping,"
" testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the "
"delay between writing code and running it in production."
